# Simple Calculator

This is a calculator that can perform basic operations, built as part of my journey through The Odin Project. 

Adding keyboard support and figuring out a way to make both it and the regular button inputs work with decimal numbers at the same time has been this project's most fun challenge.

## Technologies used: 
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Features: 
* Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) 
* Handles decimal numbers
* Supports basic memory operations (clear, delete last input)
* Keyboard support 
* In the future, I would like to make it so that the input only accepts numbers and operators; for now, it takes letters and other symbols too
